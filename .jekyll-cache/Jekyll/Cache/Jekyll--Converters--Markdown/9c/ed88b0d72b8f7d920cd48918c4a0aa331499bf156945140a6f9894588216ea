<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post I’m going to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: I’m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven, currently living in Brussels (Belgium). After finishing my studies I have worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me I’m not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two factors: push and pull. Push factors are the reasons why people decide to <em>leave</em>, pull factors are the reasons that <em>attract</em> people to a certain place. Let’s first look at the push factors.</p>

<p><strong>1) Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I think to put it mildly: Belgium’s startup ecosystem is quite modest. If I take a look at my classmates that graduated at the same time as I did, it is  noticeable that none of them went on to found a start-up. Correction: none of the ones that stayed in Belgium. In addition to this, there is a noticeable lack of succesful startups. If success breeds success, then the opposite seems to be working in Belgium. The one exception that should be noted is <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en">Imec</a>, an R&amp;D hub for nano- and digital technologies. This organization has already spun-off multiple very (succesful) startups in its specialist field. However its area of specialization is somewhat boring to me, most of their startups are lead by people with more degrees than I can count and I’ve never been about the academic life anyway.</p>

<p><strong>2) Government</strong></p>

<p>Belgian politics are broken at a fundamental level (and unlikely to be fixed anytime soon). I won’t go into the reasons why, as this is beyond the scope of this post. This brokeness has several not so fun consequences, one of them being: high taxes for a terrible service. Take a look at this graph:</p>

<p>As you can see Belgium has the highest tax rate, now mind you I’m not <em>against</em> taxes. At this tax rate however I do expect something back: a well-functioning</p>
