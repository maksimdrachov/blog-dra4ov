<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post Iâ€™m want to try to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: Iâ€™m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven (Belgium). After my studies I first worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee.</p>
