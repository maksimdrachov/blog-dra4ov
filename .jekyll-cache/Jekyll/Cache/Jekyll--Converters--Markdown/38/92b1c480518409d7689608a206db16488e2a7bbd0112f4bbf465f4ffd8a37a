<p><em>Why donâ€™t you use Bluetooth?</em></p>

<p>Five reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Bluetooth module is an order of magnitude more expensive than a LED &amp; light-sensor. Just a rough comparison:</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A Bluetooth-based communication protocol is significantly more complex than a VLC-based one, thus more vulnerable to exploits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to avoid leaking any information about the keys we want to use a faraday cage (metallic foil) that surrounds the device, this makes wireless communication impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we want the device to be as accessible as possible, we have to take into account that some (<a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/explore/devices/">very</a>) cheap phones that are popular in the developing world donâ€™t have a bluetooth module. However all phones have a (rudimentary) camera and a screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bluetooth energy consumption would result in a higher power usage, and thus a lower battery life.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Isnâ€™t the transmission kind of slow?</em></p>

<p>Yes, itâ€™s slow. Assuming you have a simple phone with a 60Hz screen and a 15Hz camera; this means transactions between the phone and the wallet are going to take in the order of minutes. However, since the wallet is meant to be used as a storage device for your savings in the first place, this doesnâ€™t seem to be such a big problem. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re going to add/withdraw funds from this wallet once every month or so, itâ€™s not such an unreasonable amount of time to wait for the transaction to complete. Anyway, itâ€™s probably safe to assume that most people will continue using fiat currency in their day-to-day transactions for the forseeable future. This device is mainly a tool to reliably store and build wealth, regardless of the political or economical situation of the userâ€™s environment.</p>

<p>However, the light.wallet <em>can</em> become a primary way of making payments in your day-to-day life as well. This all depends on the further spread of a second device: the light.terminal.</p>

<p>Where the light.wallet can be seen as the crypto successor to the bank card; the light.terminal is the equivalent of a bank card reader. It will allow you to quickly request and process a payment, since it integrates all the necessary hardware to transmit/receive the information in an instant, as opposed to using the relatively slow transmission rate of the smartphone camera.</p>

<p>One additional idea here: integrate two magnets in every light.wallet and light.terminal, which will make aligning the light-sensor and the led between the two devices easy and seamless.</p>
