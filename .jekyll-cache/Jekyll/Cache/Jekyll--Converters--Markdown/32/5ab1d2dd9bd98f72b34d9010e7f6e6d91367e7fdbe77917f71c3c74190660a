<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post I’m want to try to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: I’m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven (Belgium). After my studies I worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me I’m not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two factors: push and pull. Push factors are the reasons why people decide to <em>leave</em>, pull factors are the reasons that <em>attract</em> people to a certain place. Let’s first look at the push factors.</p>

<p><strong>1) Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I think to express it mildly: Belgium’s startup ecosystem is quite modest. If I take a look at my classmates that graduated at the same time as I did, it is clear</p>
