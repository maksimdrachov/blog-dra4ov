I"n<p>Currently I’m writing a tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-rtos-tutorial">Zephyr RTOS</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a list of topics under consideration for future tutorials:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Zephyr Tutorial for Advanced Topics</em>: A tutorial that picks up the thread where the <a href="https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-rtos-tutorial">beginners tutorial</a> leaves off. Some of the topics that I’d like to cover are: bluetooth, bootloader, security (trusted firmware), cryptography (how it applies to blockchain),…</li>
  <li><em>Blockchain for Embedded Developers</em>: A tutorial series on how to work with blockchain on embedded devices. I’ve already started to compile a bunch of interesting resources <a href="https://github.com/maksimdrachov/awesome-embedded-blockchain">here</a>.</li>
  <li><em>Renode</em>: Renode is an open source software development framework with commercial support from Antmicro that lets you develop, debug and test multi-node device systems reliably, scalably and effectively.</li>
  <li><em>Linux Kernel</em>: The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel.</li>
  <li><em>TCP/IP</em>: The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks.</li>
</ul>
