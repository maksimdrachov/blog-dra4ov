<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post Iâ€™m going to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: Iâ€™m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven, currently living in Brussels (Belgium). After finishing I worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me Iâ€™m not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two factors: push and pull. Push factors are the reasons why people decide to <em>leave</em>, pull factors are the reasons that <em>attract</em> people to a certain place. Letâ€™s first look at the push factors.</p>

<p><strong>1) Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I think to put it mildly: Belgiumâ€™s startup ecosystem is quite modest. If I take a look at my classmates that graduated at the same time as I did, it is  noticeable that none of them went on to found a start-up. Correction: none of the ones that stayed in Belgium.</p>
