<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post Iâ€™m want to try to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: Iâ€™m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven (Belgium). After my studies I worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me Iâ€™m not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two factors: push and pull. Push factors are the reason why people</p>
