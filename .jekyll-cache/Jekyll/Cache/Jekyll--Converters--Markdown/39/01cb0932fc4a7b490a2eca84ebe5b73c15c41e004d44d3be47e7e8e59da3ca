<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post I‚Äôm want to try to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: I‚Äôm 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven (Belgium). After my studies I worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me I‚Äôm not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two sides: push and pull.</p>
