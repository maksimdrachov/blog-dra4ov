<p>I have made the decision to move to Tallinn, Estonia. In this post Iâ€™m going to chart out my reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Some background: Iâ€™m 27 years old, I studied Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven, currently living in Brussels (Belgium). After finishing my studies I have worked at Nokia and then 2 startups as an early employee. The experience of working at Nokia has taught me Iâ€™m not really cut out for a big corporate structure; whereas the experience at the startups has taught me how relatively underdeveloped this field is in Belgium.</p>

<p>The decision to migrate always has two factors: push and pull. Push factors are the reasons why people decide to <em>leave</em>, pull factors are the reasons that <em>attract</em> people to a certain place. Letâ€™s first look at the push factors.</p>

<p><strong>1) Ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I think to put it mildly: Belgiumâ€™s startup ecosystem is quite modest. If I take a look at my classmates that graduated at the same time as I did, it is  noticeable that none of them went on to found a start-up. Correction: none of the ones that stayed in Belgium. In addition to this, there is a noticeable lack of succesful startups. If success breeds success, then the opposite seems to be working in Belgium. The one exception that should be noted is <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en">Imec</a>, an R&amp;D hub for nano- and digital technologies. This organization has already spun-off multiple very (succesful) startups in its specialist field. However its area of specialization is somewhat boring to me, most of their startups are lead by people with more degrees than I can count and Iâ€™ve never been about the academic life anyway.</p>

<p><strong>2) Government</strong></p>

<p>Belgian politics are broken at a fundamental level (and unlikely to be fixed anytime soon). I wonâ€™t go into the reasons why, as this is beyond the scope of this post. This brokeness has several not so fun consequences, one of them being: high taxes for a terrible service. Take a look at this graph:</p>

<p>As you can see Belgium has the highest tax rate, now mind you Iâ€™m not <em>against</em> taxes. At this tax rate however I do expect to get something back: a well-functioning political system. A couple of months ago I posted the following on my LinkedIn:</p>

<p>Translation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The link below gives a template for every kind of contract you could need as a start-up in Estonia. How come I canâ€™t find something similar for Belgium?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tagged every one of our (useless) ministers (remember: <strong>6</strong> governments) that could have something to do with this simple questions. 1600 people saw the post, no one cared to answer.</p>

<p>With taxes this high, and government that clearly doesnâ€™t care about improving I was starting to have doubts about staying. Thatâ€™s when the Belgian police came to the resque. You see, I wasnâ€™t 100% sure of leaving just <em>yet</em>, but this one broke the dam.</p>

<p>I needed to pick up some stuff from the office (at work). Trying to be smart, I thought it would be best if I went during noon, right in between the worst of the morning and evening traffic (Brussels is notorious for this). Unfortunately that day the police decided to have a strike and closed off the ring of Brussels. This led to the disastrous effect of everyone losing a couple of hours standing in traffic jams. This is when I decided I wasnâ€™t going to stay; this country is clearly not heading in the right direction.</p>
