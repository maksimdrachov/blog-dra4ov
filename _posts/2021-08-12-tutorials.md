Currently I'm writing a tutorial on [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-rtos-tutorial).

The following is a list of topics under consideration for future tutorials:
- *Zephyr Tutorial for Advanced Topics*: A tutorial that picks up the thread where the [beginners tutorial](https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-rtos-tutorial) leaves off. Some of the topics that I'd like to cover are: bluetooth, bootloader, security (trusted firmware), cryptography (how it applies to blockchain),...
- *Blockchain for Embedded Developers*: A tutorial series on how to work with blockchain on embedded devices. I've already started to compile a bunch of interesting resources [here](https://github.com/maksimdrachov/awesome-embedded-blockchain).
- *Renode*: Renode is an open source software development framework with commercial support from Antmicro that lets you develop, debug and test multi-node device systems reliably, scalably and effectively.
- *Linux Kernel*: The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel.
- *TCP/IP*: The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks.
