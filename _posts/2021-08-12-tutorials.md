As a junior engineer I aknowledge that I still have a lot to learn.

I've found that while learning I've found it useful to write down my notes in a tutorial-like form. This way I can make sure I'm actually learning and not just quickly glancing over the material.

Currently I'm writing a tutorial on [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/maksimdrachov/zephyr-rtos-tutorial).

The following is a list of topics under consideration for future tutorials:
- **Renode**: Renode is an open source software development framework with commercial support from Antmicro that lets you develop, debug and test multi-node device systems reliably, scalably and effectively.
- **Linux Kernel**: The Linux kernel is a free and open-source,[5][6] monolithic, modular,[7] multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel.
- **TCP/IP**: The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks.
- **Cryptocurrency for Embedded Developers**: A tutorial series on how to work with cryptocurrencies on embedded devices.
