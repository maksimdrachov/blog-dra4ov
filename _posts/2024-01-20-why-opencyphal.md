title: "why opencyphal?"
---

Cyphal is an open source protocol that provides an abstraction for real-time intravehicular communication based on modern networking standards (Ethernet, CAN FD, etc.). It was created to address the challenge of deterministic data distribution on highly integrated systems such as:

- cars
- drones
- robots
- spacecraft
- sattelites
- ...

By providing a common framework for such systems for both developers of modules on one hand; as well as developers of fully integrated systems (as customers of the first group). Both groups can collaborate seamlessly across company lines (as long as all parties adhere to the Cyphal specification).

The benefit of building a drone system based on OpenCyphal should become apparent both during development, as well as afterwards during exploitation:

Benefits during development:

- Each subsystem can be modeled/debugged seperately
-
