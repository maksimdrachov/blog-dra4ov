title: "Sunday Dev Sessions"
---

For the last couple of months I've started developing the habit of meeting with like-minded friends on Sunday. 

I find these days are often very engaging since it means: we get to catch up, discuss interesting topics and work on side projects.

Because I feel like it could be interesting to open this up to other people as well, I'd like to make an open call for anyone who is interested in joining these sessions.

So if you're
- interested in technology
    - electronics (IoT, drones, ...)
    - 3d printing
    - blockchain
    - machine learning
    - data science
    - web development
    - ...
- want to learn from others
- want to share knowledge
- work on some side project

Feel free to contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maksimdrachov) or by [e-mail](mailto:maksim.drachov@outlook.com).
Please write a short paragraph about yourself and your interests.

For reference, here are some of the people that you *might* meet.
