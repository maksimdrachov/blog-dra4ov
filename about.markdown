Hi,

My name is Maksim Drachov. I live in Brussels.

I work as an Embedded Software Engineer at [Yada Studio](https://www.yada.brussels/).

My main areas of interest are:
- Electronics
- Art ([glitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art), [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art), [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_art))
- Community building (Manifesto)

If you're interested, you can find more on my personal Notion [page](https://yadastudio.notion.site/yadastudio/dra4ov-92db3dfca938418b9932a89a93731bbe).
